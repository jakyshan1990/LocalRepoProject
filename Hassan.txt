I see the confusion now! You’re distinguishing between mechanical pressure (acting on the actuator) and supply pressure (P_supply). Let’s carefully correct the equations and ensure the pressure-actuated spring system is modeled correctly.

Step 1: Define System Variables

We have:
	•	P_{\text{mech}} → Mechanical pressure acting on the actuator.
	•	P_{\text{supply}} → Supply pressure driving the system.
	•	P_{\text{measured}} → The final measured pressure after restriction.
	•	x → Linear displacement of the actuator affecting flow restriction.

The actuator force is:
F = A P_{\text{mech}}
where:
	•	A = Actuator piston area (m²)
	•	P_{\text{mech}} = Mechanical pressure on the actuator (Pa)

This force moves the mass-spring-damper system:

M \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + B \frac{dx}{dt} + K x = A P_{\text{mech}}

The measured pressure is affected by displacement:

P_{\text{measured}} = P_{\text{supply}} - C x

where C is a flow restriction coefficient (Pa/m).

Step 2: Transfer Function Derivation

Taking Laplace Transform:

M s^2 X(s) + B s X(s) + K X(s) = A P_{\text{mech}}(s)

Solving for X(s):

X(s) = \frac{A}{M s^2 + B s + K} P_{\text{mech}}(s)

Now, using the pressure relationship:

P_{\text{measured}}(s) = P_{\text{supply}}(s) - C X(s)

P_{\text{measured}}(s) = P_{\text{supply}}(s) - C \frac{A}{M s^2 + B s + K} P_{\text{mech}}(s)

Now, to express P_{\text{mech}} in terms of P_{\text{supply}}, we use a mechanical pressure dynamics equation:

P_{\text{mech}} = \frac{P_{\text{supply}} - P_{\text{measured}}}{R}

where R is a resistance factor (Pa·s/m³) accounting for pressure loss due to restricted flow. Taking Laplace Transform:

P_{\text{mech}}(s) = \frac{P_{\text{supply}}(s) - P_{\text{measured}}(s)}{R}

Substituting this into our previous equation:

P_{\text{measured}}(s) = P_{\text{supply}}(s) - C \frac{A}{M s^2 + B s + K} \frac{P_{\text{supply}}(s) - P_{\text{measured}}(s)}{R}

Rearranging:

P_{\text{measured}}(s) + \frac{C A}{R (M s^2 + B s + K)} P_{\text{measured}}(s) = P_{\text{supply}}(s) \left( 1 - \frac{C A}{R (M s^2 + B s + K)} \right)

P_{\text{measured}}(s) \left( 1 + \frac{C A}{R (M s^2 + B s + K)} \right) = P_{\text{supply}}(s) \left( 1 - \frac{C A}{R (M s^2 + B s + K)} \right)

Solving for P_{\text{measured}}(s) / P_{\text{supply}}(s):

G(s) = \frac{P_{\text{measured}}(s)}{P_{\text{supply}}(s)} = \frac{1 - \frac{C A}{R (M s^2 + B s + K)}}{1 + \frac{C A}{R (M s^2 + B s + K)}}

Step 3: MATLAB Simulation

clc; clear; close all;

% Given system parameters
A = 0.01;   % Actuator area (m²)
M = 2;      % Mass (kg)
B = 10;     % Damping coefficient (Ns/m)
K = 100;    % Spring stiffness (N/m)
C = 0.05;   % Flow restriction factor
R = 0.1;    % Resistance factor (Pa·s/m³)

s = tf('s');  % Define Laplace variable
G_x = A / (M*s^2 + B*s + K);
G_pressure = (1 - (C * G_x) / R) / (1 + (C * G_x) / R);

Step 4: Next Steps
	1.	Validate System Parameters: Experimentally measure M, B, K, C, R.
	2.	Stability Analysis: Use root locus or Bode plot to check system stability.
	3.	Controller Design: Use PID tuning to maintain desired pressure levels.

Does this now correctly represent your system behavior?
